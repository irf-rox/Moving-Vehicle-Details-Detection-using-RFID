Moving vehicle details detection using RFID

Abstract:
The Moving Vehicle Detection System using RFID (Radio-Frequency Identification) is a technology that enables the detection and tracking of moving vehicles through RFID tags. This system utilizes RFID readers without antennas or a power source to capture data transmitted by RFID tags that are affixed to every vehicle in the upcoming future according to the recent government GOE/scheme which states that every vehicle that is being manufactured will come with an in-built RFID tag. The collected data is then processed and analysed to determine the vehicle's location, license plate number and other details. This abstract presents an overview of the Moving Vehicle Detection System using RFID and its potential applications in traffic management, parking management, and logistics operations. The proposed system offers several advantages, including real-time monitoring, accurate data collection, and efficient traffic flow management. 
Eg : Similar to fast tags, ID card tap attendance, clothing tag alarms, etc.
